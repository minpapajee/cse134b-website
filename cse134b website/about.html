        <summary>A lil information about me</summary>
        <p>
            I am studying <span class="interests">Computer Science</span> at the University of California, San Diego. 
            I'm still figuring out where my degree will take me, but so far I'm very intersted in 
            <span class="interests">Front-End development</span> and <span class="interests">Machine Learning</span>! 
            <aside>
                <p>
                    UCSD is a great school, and while I am learning a lot about programming here, it has moreso changed
                    me as an indvidual. If you're debating going or sending your kids to UCSD, I would highly recommend it!

            For any UCSD alumnis and students, these were some of my favorite classes. Even if you're
            not affiliated with the school, you might find some of these interesting!

        <summary>Hobbies</summary>
        <p>
            While my main focus is on programming, I'm human too! I enjoy various activities such as gaming,
            listening to <span class="interests">korean hiphop</span>, <span class="interests">cooking</span>, and 
            <span class="interests">lifting. There are only so many opportunities and so 
            little time in our lives, so I want to be able to say I lived a cool life to my future kids.

        <summary>Something I want to share</summary>
        <p>
            When I'm driving, coding, or having a tough time, I like to play a song. I've shared this song with
            my family, friends, and roomates so I'd like to share it to you too. It's a Korean song, so I admit,
            it's weird to put on an english portfolio. Still, I hope you enjoy it.

        <p>
            This personalized portfolio is done as a part of my school project. However, it is an accurate
            representation of who I am, and I intend to continue optimizing this page well after my class
            ends.
